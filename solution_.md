# WO vs Beer Consumption in NL
![WO vs Beer Consumption in NL](plot.png)

The graph above depicts the percent increase of the university student population (blue line) and the beer consumption percent increase in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018. The data were converted to % increases so that they can be related to eachother in a more meaningful way. The WO line has an almost steady positive trend throughout the years, with a small decrease in 2013. As for the beer consumption data, there is no visible increase until 2012, when the line starts rising, with a much lower slope than the WO line. After studying the graph, one can find no strong relation between the two categories. The increase in students, does increase the beer consumption, but only in the expected degree of the increase in people who can drink. Beer consumpution does not seem to be that much dependent on students, since it is steady for the first half of the diagram, even though students did increase. However, on the second half, it does increase with increasing students, but this increase could also be due to the increase in some other population category in NL.
